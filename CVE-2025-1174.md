### Fix Recommendation:
Input Validation & Sanitization:
Properly validate and sanitize user inputs before storing them in the database.
Use functions like htmlspecialchars() or htmlentities() in PHP to encode special characters.

Output Escaping:
Escape output before rendering it on the page to prevent script execution.
Use frameworks’ built-in escaping functions, such as htmlspecialchars($data, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8').
